    <p>
        Pakistan short history as a country has been very turbulent.<br>
        Fighting among the provinces--as well as a deep-rooted conflict that led to a nuclear stand-off with Indiaâ€”prevented Pakistan from gaining real stability in the last five decades.<br>
        It oscillates between military rule and democratically elected governments, between secular policies and financial backing as a "frontline" state during the Cold War and the war against terrorism.<br>
        Recent declared states of emergency and the political assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto indicate a continuing trend of economic and political instability.
